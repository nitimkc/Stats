++ The variability of stochastic gradient descent 

+ Find the Fisher Information matrix for logistic regression models

+ Use the 1st 500K observations from the HIGGS data set to calculate
the MLE, the Fisher information matrix and, hence obtain the standard
errors of the estimators when all features are present.

+ Describe in approx 1-page, the methodology of stochastic gradient
descent its default implementation in the sgd R package

+ Fit the same logistic regression model using stachastic gradient
descent. You should do this for each of 1, 5, 10, ..., 50 passes
through the data, starting from the MLE. For each number of passes,
repeat the estimation for 50 independent random permutations of the
data. As an outcome, you should produce an appropriate figure that
illustrates the variability of the estimators due to permutation as a
function of the number of passes and compares it to the varibility of
MLE.
